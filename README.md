Using two popular JavaScript libraries for producing web-based data visualizations, D3.js and Chart.js, I created a visualization on crime in New York State, with a focus on crime outside of New York City. Divided by counties, the datasets used were gathered over the course of 2017 and encompass the violent crimes of murder/non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault, as well as the property crimes of burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft. Primary visualization methods used include a choropleth map and a bar graph.

Note: For the purpose of this visualization, the arbitrary term 'Upstate New York' encompasses all New York State counties outside of the 5 boroughs of New York City.
